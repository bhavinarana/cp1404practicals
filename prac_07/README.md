## Main Lessons on Clean Code

Throughout this subject, I've learned valuable principles that have enhanced my ability to write clean and maintainable code:

- **Use meaningful names**: Naming variables, functions, and classes descriptively helps make the code more understandable and reduces the need for comments.
- **Follow the single responsibility principle**: Ensuring each function has one purpose keeps the code organized and easy to modify.
- **Write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code**: Avoiding repetition minimizes potential errors
